<h1>My Amazing app!</h1>

<p>This was compiled by <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-module' target="_blank">bundle-module</a>, the no-config Webpack module that allows you to `import` and `require` all of your HTML, CSS/LESS/SCSS, and data files into one self-assembling script <em>without redundant local Webpack configurations</em> in every app.</p>

<p>The module currently supports many commonly used libraries. For example, this is a static page constructed by importing both <code>SCSS</code> and <code>LESS</code> stylesheets, <code>vanilla HTML</code> and an <code>EJS template</code>, which is populated by importing a <code>.CSV</code> file and four <code>PNG</code> images, all baked into a single file.</p>

<p>Please <a href='mailto:wilson@mechanicalscribe.com'>let me know</a> which filetypes and libraries you want to import that I'm missing.</p>
